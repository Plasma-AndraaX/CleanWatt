# CleanWatt

**Large Android battery widget for people with declining eyesight.**

Stop squinting at the tiny battery icon in the status bar. CleanWatt displays your battery level in large format on your home screen: percentage, charging status, temperature, and health. It also monitors connected Bluetooth devices (headphones, watches, gamepads, etc.) and shows their battery levels. Real-time updates, no ads, no tracking.
